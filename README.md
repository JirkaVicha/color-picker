### Color-Picker App
This app is like a color picker tool. It displays a list of color names, and when you click on one, the background color of the page changes to that color. At the top, it shows the currently selected color name. You can easily switch between colors by clicking on the buttons. It's a simple yet effective way to explore different colors and visualize how they look.
